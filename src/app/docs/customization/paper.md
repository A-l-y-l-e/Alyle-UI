## Basic paper

<p>
  If you do not set a value for the <code
    class="typescript"
  >bg</code> attribute, the <code
    class="typescript"
  >paper</code> (is a variable of the theme and is equal to <code
    class="typescript"
  >#fff</code>) value is set by default. This only applies to <code
    class="typescript">ly-bg</code>.
