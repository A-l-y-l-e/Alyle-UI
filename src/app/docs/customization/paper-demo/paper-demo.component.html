  With paper it is easier to build surfaces for your application.
</p>

<h2 lyTyp="display1" gutter>Basic paper</h2>

<p>
  If you do not set a value for the <span
    prism
    code="bg"
    language="typescript"
  ></span> attribute, the <span
    prism
    code="paper"
    language="typescript"
  ></span> (is a variable of the theme and is equal to <span
    prism
    code="#fff"
    language="typescript"
  ></span>) value is set by default. This only applies to <span
    prism code="ly-bg" language="typescript"></span>.

<h2 lyTyp="display1" gutter>Paper with color</h2>
